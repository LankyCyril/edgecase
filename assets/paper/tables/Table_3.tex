    \small Adjusted \textit{p}-values of the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on relative Levenshtein distances.
    For each read among all telomeric reads on each arm,
    closest distances to groups of reads described in the \textit{Comparison} column are compared
    (see \hyperref[sec:methods]{Materials and Methods}).
